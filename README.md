## Adventure Guide
I'll skip the basics to get to the non-obvious stuff. Almost everything in this game is based on your "current distance" to the middle of the maze, which is how many rooms you would have to cross to get back to the beginning.\
\
Your "cleared rooms" are also added in along with your base luck to get "luck factor," which determines odds for getting good things (non-resources). But distance matters much more.\
\
There are certain "break-point" distances where various key items and upgrades become available:\
1 • No resources are available, making it very easy to get your 2nd sword.\
2 • The Compass is available. The Compass always points to the center of the maze. Also, the limit on Swords goes to 7.\
3 • Bombs are available. They deal as much damage as attacking, but with a three turn delay. \
5 • Skillponts are available. The limit on Armor goes to 1. \
7 •  Boots are available. Boots reduce the input delay, allowing you (and the enemies) to move faster. This can be dangerous! \
10 • The Map, Gems and the 1st set of Cards are available. The Map shows the current room, the 8 rooms around you, and room clear status. Limit on Armor goes to 15. \
14 • The limit on Swords goes to 17.\
20 • 2nd set of Cards\
25 • The artifact is available.\
30 • 3rd set of Cards\
40 • The 1st GoldenHeart is available. Each one increases your hearts gain, when collecting hearts. Limit on Armor goes to 30 and Swords goes to 39.\
45 • The EodArmor is available, which protects you from your own bombs.\
60 • 2nd GoldenHeart is available.\
80 • 3rd GoldenHeart is available.\
81 • The Unlimited Key can drop from enemies.\
100 • The limit on Armor goes to 40 and Swords goes to 50. Final 200 skillpoints.\
A detailed breakdown of this, as well as the strength of enemies per distance, is found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13-jvYlJXHsSpP6Iv2k-Bj1w_Rfnao-bTAPgRXfwUU_Y \

## Military Perks Guide
**(MT4) Specializations:** \
Powerplant > Mine > Factory\
(More Info On Why Below This Text)\
\
**(MT 1-3) Group 1:**\
Backups > Libraries > Improved Conditions
Backups as first choice since it can help a lot early game by making your modules T1 max every next MT-up, which saves time and resources.\
Libraries as second choice since it increases town exp gained, won't be that much of use when picked first.\
Improved Conditions as the third choice basically because worker slots are expensive to get at this point of the game.\
\
**(MT5 ) Group 2:**\
Duplicates = Existence Taxes > Symmetrical Analysis\
Duplicates is like Backups but your modules will be set to T5 max instead of T1 max, which saves you time and resources making it a good first choice.\
Existence Taxes increases your total resource drops for each town level, making resource farming better, which makes it also a good first choice.\
Symmetrical Analysis multiplies resource drops from enemies with your module chance factor, won't be that useful unless you have a big module chance factor.\
\
**(MT9) Group 3:**\
International Experts > Combat Surveillance > Essence Purification\
International Experts makes town perks use your current military tier x 2 when calculating the total bonus of a perk, making it the best first choice.\
Combat Surveillance increases your tower testing xp drop rate by your town resource drop rate, which helps a lot since you'll need tower testing xp at era, but not when reaching era 5, making it a good second choice.\
Essence Purification increases the base damage bonus per elemental essence in the workshop from 1% to 5%, you'll likely use all your essence on getting the modules, not that helpful on era, pick it last.\
\
**(MT13) Group 4:**\
Eternity Anvil > Time Warping = Twin Singularity\
Anvil is great, Eternity Anvil increases anvil range, which is great, pick this first.\
The other two doesn't matter till MT15\

## Power Plant guide
**The best known setup with Floor 2. Needs "Quantum Grid" to be most effective.**
```
1ZVBCgMhDEVP1F7AXTc9QHuBDKaDIIlkIoO37yAUhsJYW8fSbkIk0f/+3xh4RgkeSI+ewXJUEwQPjm6OnCZj08R0RkIBZTEjTNcogyPcYxJcQCNoT6CKkjbavNWVYzXJYuVSB1wuLzLpD/DfCTxT1F5pcp3Qe54fkqXTV+wvL1yWfRirttvt5zL4iO+G3m71E9Umr2vBrb63850YfjuHDv9JNXNPlDs=
```
Requires ~2e30 cubes for the pipes, see below for a cheaper option.
Look in "technology" and click on things if you haven't done that yet. The battery "deep link" upgrades boost all power capacity, which is why you want a balance for maximum capacity.\
It is very important that the two pipe grids be separated by the gas tank. If they are joined, they will become a single grid, which is only capable of supplying 12.5 (effectively 12) gas turbines at a time.\
\
**Cheaper design: Not quite as effective as the best, but only costs e20 resources.**
```

## 100b waves Guide
A ⁠mt-6-and-7 player's guide to getting the dreaded 100b waves(the blueprint also works for reaching mt7)™️\
\
1.Turn down as many graphical setting as you can, to raise fps(increases enemy spawn speed).  check here for a BP and AI for this, which WILL die from time to time at higher waves, it will still progress fast though.( ⁠module-blueprints⁠mt6-7 wave goal blueprint ). for the 100b BP build(the blueprint string goes into workshop BLUEPRINTS tab, NOT AI) type the command !modules in the discord to find missing module locations] \
\
2. clear as many normal mode difficulties(the mode to clear wave 100; every difficulty counts separate, even if on same region, for a total of 90 locations) as you can. this is to make your run faster overall because it buffs the software "wave storm" \
3. restart every 5 minutes(real time, click the bomb icon bottom left and press "restart"). as of the infinity rework update, the software got buffed, and you reset forever (note: if you are using my blueprint, once you start dying dont worry about resets) . this is to get the new affect from a software called "wave catalyst". \
\
make sure to complete all possible challenges, because challenge 3-4 buffs wave streaming: +1% factor for every completed challenge \
please make sure you have at least module level 12, and a even amount of at least tier 8 stones in museum \
the push to 100b itself should take ~30m-1h. good luck
